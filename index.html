                <p><center>This resource is dedicated to providing early childhood educators content through which they can nurture creativity in young learners.</center></p>

                <h3><i>Definition of Creativity</i></h3>
				<p>In the words of  (Linda 2024) “The process of bringing fresh, inventive concepts to life is called creativity. The capacity to observe the world in novel ways, uncover hidden patterns, link seemingly unconnected occurrences, and come up with answers are all traits of creativity. Thinking and creating are the two steps in the creative process. You are imaginative but not creative if you have ideas but don't follow through on them. Due to the quick speed of change and the demand for fresh, original answers to challenging issues, creativity is becoming more and more crucial in today's environment. Being creative is what defines us as human. We would stagnate without invention, which is the lifeblood of growth. In the era of artificial intelligence, creativity provides us a competitive edge. Even while AI is a very useful tool, it cannot replace human ingenuity.”</p>
				<h3><i>Importance of Creativity</i></h3>
				<p>Creativity is crucial because of the following impacts that it has on humans as also stated by (National Youth Council of Ireland 2023):</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>
				  Different ways of thinking are made possible by creativity. 
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  It breaks previous thought patterns or habits. It makes non-linear thinking possible. 
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  Empathy is made possible by creativity. 
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  Being creative helps us connect with ourselves.
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  Participation in the creative process fosters a sense of community. 
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  It fosters interpersonal relationships and helps develop collaboration and collaborative abilities. 
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  Reflection and action can be linked via creativity. 
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  Creativity fosters cross-cultural relationships.
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  It allows us to interact with people from other ethnicities and subcultures. 
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  Confidence is fostered by creativity. 
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  Being creative boosts self-esteem. Young individuals are less susceptible to outside influence when they are self-assured. 
				  </li>
				  <li>
				  Curiosity is fostered by creativity.
				  </li>
				</ul>
				<h3><i>How is creativity Reflected in EYLF?</i></h3>
				<p>The following are some significant ways that creativity is ingrained in the EYLF's guiding principles and objectives: </p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				The  <strong> EYLF's Outcome 4</strong> highlights the significance of giving kids opportunity to explore, learn, and create. 
				</li>
				<li>
				The  <strong> EYLF's Outcome 5</strong> emphasises that children may express themselves via art, music, and theatre. 
				</li>
				<li>
				Teachers are urged to establish settings that inspire children to think creatively and to go on an exploratory voyage of discovery about the world.  (Leggett 2024)
				</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><i>Introduction to The power of Art</i></h3>
				<p>In the opinion of (ArtsFairfaxstg 2022), “It is impossible to dispute the value of the arts. They foster children's self-esteem, creativity, and language and communication abilities. Children who may not otherwise encounter fascinating subjects like history, geography, maths, physics, and technology are also introduced to them through the arts. Children who participate in the arts acquire important lifelong learning skills. They may also provide kids a way to express their creativity and present them with useful knowledge they might not otherwise know. It is crucial to support the arts in every aspect of a child's development.”</p>
				<h3><i>Creativity Theories and Perspectives in Art and Early Childhood</i></h3>
				<p>
				A number of hypotheses have been proposed to demonstrate the significance of art in the lives of children throughout their formative years. The following is a discussion of the theories:
				<ul>
				<li>
				<strong>Piaget’s Constructivism </strong> - Piaget emphasised how children naturally actively develop their knowledge via interaction and investigation of their immediate environment. In this regard, art is essential. In order to better grasp the world around them, it enables the kids to get hands-on and sensory-rich experiences. (Cognitive Constructivism | GSI Teaching & Resource Center n.d.)
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> Vygotsky’s Sociocultural theory  </strong> - In his theory, Vygotsky highlighted the significance of social contact for children's cognitive development. Art entails teamwork, communication, and the use of materials and methods unique to a culture. Children's social learning is subsequently encouraged by this. (Cherry, McLeod, & OFFICE OF EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT 2022)
				</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h3><i>Resources, Materials, and Digital Technologies for Art </i></h3>
				<p>The following resources can be used by ECE to get the kids interested in art: </p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<strong> Traditional Materials </strong> -  The use of paints, crayons, markers, sketching pens, coloured pencils, papers in various colours, textures, sizes, and forms, clay, playdough, and other creative tools as needed are examples of traditional materials.   
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> Tools </strong> -  These consist of palettes, brushes, rollers, stamps, and so on. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> Digital Technologies </strong> -  One contemporary art form that makes use of tablets with drawing applications and digital pens is digital art. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> Environment </strong> -  Natural outside areas can be used for large-scale works or as a source of inspiration. 
				</li>
				</ul>
				<h3><i>Examples of Learning Experiences to Develop Creativity in Art</i></h3>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<strong>0-2 years</strong> - Playdough exploration, learning to scribble, Exploring various textures using different readily available materials. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>2-3 years </strong> - Making collage with different material, Creating basic art works using brushes and paint. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> 3-5 years </strong> - Learning to use clay to make simple faces / figures, Learning to mix colours, Basic art techniques like folding/cutting etc. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> 6-8 years</strong> -  Learning collaboration by working on group art projects, Getting introduced to advanced art skills. 
				</li>
				</ul>
				<h3><i>Original Creative Learning Opportunities</i></h3>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<strong>0-2 years</strong> - Texture Collage - The educators can make the children explore various textures (fabric, paper, etc.) on a sticky surface.
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>2-3 years </strong> - Marble Painting - The educators can help make the children roll marbles in paint on paper for abstract art.
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> 3-5 years </strong> - Clay Faces - The educators can help children sculpt simple faces with clay and tools.
				</li>
				</ul>

                     </video>
				<h3><i> Critical Reflection and Evaluation </i></h3>
				<p>
				My creative tendencies as an ECE will undoubtedly improve my capacity to use creativity in art. I think it's important to keep an eye out for strategies to keep kids interested. Children learn more by doing things themselves, in my opinion, than by only being told information. My eagerness to try new things and my open-mindedness in teaching and learning enable me to put a lot of effort into giving kids a secure space where they may experiment with various forms of self-expression. My keen observational abilities enable me to watch each child and assess their strengths and shortcomings, which subsequently aids me in developing a customised strategy to improve their learning. I have a strong desire to inspire children's creativity and curiosity. The most significant and effective way to help kids become more conscious, self-assured, and expressive, in my opinion, is via art. They can learn more about themselves and the world around them via art. I have a deep commitment to fostering an environment in my classroom where kids may learn more effectively via art and develop their own creativity.

				<h3><i>Introduction to The sheer magic of Drama and Puppetry</i></h3>
				<p>Around the world, puppetry has been a significant tool for information dissemination. Every kind of art, including literature, painting, sculpture, music, dance, and theatre, is infused into puppetry, which also helps pupils grow as creative beings. In India, puppetry has long been a popular and affordable way to spread knowledge about Indian myths and tales. Puppetry has been chosen as a communication medium to help teach in schools because it is a dynamic art form that appeals to all age groups. (Role of puppetry in Education | Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT) n.d.)</p>
				<p>Although drama is frequently thought of as entertainment, it provides much more than just a stage for performers. It stimulates critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and creativity. In addition to learning how to perform on stage, drama education helps students develop their communication skills, confidence, and critical thinking abilities. (Tombak 2014)</p>
				<h3><i>Creativity Theories and Perspectives in Drama and Puppetry and Early Childhood</i></h3>
				<p>
				Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to demonstrate the significance of puppetry and theatre in the lives of young children. The following is a discussion of the theories:
				<ul>
				<li>
				<strong> Vygotsky’s Sociocultural theory  </strong> - In his theory, Vygotsky emphasised the role that play plays in children's cognitive development. Children have fantastic possibilities to engage in play where they may adopt social roles and develop their communication abilities via both puppetry and theatre. (Brodie 2024)
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> Bruner’s Theory of Cognitive Development </strong> - Burner asserts that story is a crucial component of education. Children may enhance their storytelling abilities by creating and performing stories through drama and puppetry. (Jerome Bruner n.d.)
				</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h3><i>Resources, Materials, and Digital Technologies for Drama and Puppetry </i></h3>
				<p>The following is a list of the several tools that ECE may use to get kids interested in theatre and puppetry: </p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<strong> Physical Space </strong> - Teachers need to allocate a room for dramatic performances where the necessary props may be moved about. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> Props </strong> - All of the costumes, hats, scarves, playthings, puppets, puppet theatres, etc. are considered props. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> Material for creating puppets </strong> - Teachers need to ensure that all the supplies, such as fabric, buttons, glue, paper bags, socks, and other items, are on hand.   
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> Digital Technologies </strong> - Children's performances can be recorded using digital cameras. Online resources for making digital puppets are another option available to instructors. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> Music and Sound Effects </strong> -  To make the drama appear more vibrant, recordings of music and sound effects should be made available. 
				</li>
				</ul>
				<h3><i>Examples of Learning Experiences to Develop Creativity in Drama and Puppetry</i></h3>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<strong>0-2 years</strong> - Being introduced to Imitative play, Peek-a-boo games, Exploring different textures.
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>2-3 years </strong> - Acting out characters from stories or simply enacting stories ,Role play with the teacher helping the students out. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> 3-5 years </strong> - Setting up puppet shows based on story books, Learning to create puppets out of readily available material. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> 6-8 years</strong> - Learning to use digital tools and where these can be used in drama and puppetry. 
				</li>
				</ul>
				<h3><i>Original Creative Learning Opportunities</i></h3>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<strong>0-2 years</strong> - The educators can make the children play Peek-a-Boo with Props. Herein they can use scarves or hats for varied peek-a-boo.
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>2-3 years </strong> - The educators can arrange an Animal Action Songs and act out animal movements to songs.
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong> 3-5 years </strong> - The educators can create a Puppet Show from a Book. They can choose a story from a storybook and create a puppet show based on that storybook's story.
				</li>
				</ul>
				<h3><i>Digital Evidence</i></h3>
				<p>Please click on the video below, you can find me actually performing all the previously mentioned original creative learning opportunities. </p>
                    <video width="900" height="700" controls> <source src="DramaVideoEvidence.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                     </video> 								 
				<h3><i> Critical Reflection and Evaluation </i></h3>
				<p>
				I am in an excellent position to facilitate creativity in theatre and puppetry because of my propensity for storytelling. I actively participate in both imaginary play and storytelling because I find them to be fascinating. Children may, in my opinion, explore their emotions, grow in empathy, and gain confidence via theatre and puppetry. I can interact with pupils more effectively in theatrical performances since I am a creative person. My eagerness to try new things and my open-mindedness in teaching and learning enable me to put a lot of effort into giving kids a secure space where they may experiment with various forms of self-expression. My keen observational abilities enable me to watch each child and assess their strengths and shortcomings, which subsequently aids me in developing a customised strategy to improve their learning. I have a strong desire to inspire children's creativity and curiosity.
